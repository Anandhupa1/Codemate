## Project Description 
- **Description:** TutorTrack is a web application designed to help students schedule appointments with tutors. It features a backend system responsible for managing student data, tutor availability, and appointment scheduling. Amazon SES is utilized for sending appointment confirmations and reminders to students. The system design incorporates a load balancer to distribute traffic evenly across multiple servers, ensuring scalability and efficient resource utilization.

Let's break down the project into more detailed pointers:

**1. Student Registration and Authentication:**

- Implement a user registration system for students, allowing them to create accounts on the platform.
- Provide secure authentication mechanisms, such as password hashing and salting, to protect user credentials.
- Implement features like email verification or password reset to enhance security and user experience.

**2. Tutor Management :**

- Store tutor information in a MongoDB database.
- Maintain a collection of tutors, including their profiles, expertise, availability, and other relevant details.
- Implement CRUD operations to manage tutors, allowing administrators to add, update, or remove tutor information.

**3. Appointment Scheduling and Management:**

- Design an intuitive interface for students to schedule appointments with tutors.
- Implement a scheduling system that checks tutor availability and handles appointment conflicts.
- Store appointment details, including student information, tutor assigned, appointment time, and any additional notes, in the database for easy retrieval.

**4. Appointment Confirmations and Reminders Amazon SES (Can use other services as well):**

- Utilize Amazon SES (Simple Email Service) to send appointment confirmations and reminders to students.
- Configure email templates for appointment confirmations and reminders, providing essential details such as appointment time, tutor information, and meeting location (if applicable).
- Use Amazon SES APIs or SDKs to send personalized emails to students, ensuring effective communication.

**5. Load Balancer for Traffic Distribution:**

- Incorporate a load balancer into the system design to evenly distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers.
- Configure the load balancer to balance the load based on factors like server health, response time, or round-robin scheduling.
- Ensure that the load balancer seamlessly handles scaling up or down as traffic demands change.

Remember to follow best practices for each technology, write well-documented code, and thoroughly test the project to ensure its functionality, scalability, and reliability.
